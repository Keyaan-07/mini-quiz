# Mini Quiz
I basically have made this simple project to get started with high seas...


## Code Explanation
We first create a list that has dictionaries in it that contain the questions,
then we select random 5 questions out of the given questions.  
Then, we set a for loop to start asking questions.  
It takes the answer and increments the score variable if correct answer is given
and if a wrong answer is given, the score does not increment.  
It asks 5 questions in total and displays the score out of 5 at the end
